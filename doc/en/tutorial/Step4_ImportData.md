## Step 4:  Import sample data to Mobile Backend 

The Mobile Application described in this tutorial needs sample data.  Use the Huawei Mobile Backend Dashboard to import the data.  

Follow the steps below to import sample data into Mobile Backend:  

1.	In a web browser, launch the Mobile Backend Dashboard.  It was created previously in Step 1 along with the Mobile Backend.  Determine the Application URL of the Mobile Backend in Service Stage Console [https://console.huaweicloud.com/servicestage/?region=cn-north-1#/apps/list](https://console.huaweicloud.com/servicestage/?region=cn-north-1#/apps/list). The url will contain the name you picked during provisioning, for example, http://johnsmbaas.cn-north-1.proapp.today.
